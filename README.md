# CARL GUSTAF WE LOVE YOU :heart:

You have FIVE minutes to replicate the website. You can check the Internet but you CANNOT preview what you are coding in the browser. You can download pictures, search for code examples and use them. When you are done, add, commit and push your file!

## Rules
- You have five minutes.
- No JavaScript is allowed.
- You cannot check your code in the browser (nor any other tool).
- You CAN "steal" code :D!
- You can use pictures from the Internet (link to it using `<img src="URL_HERE">`).

## How to submit
- Edit `index.html` in YOUR FOLDER, **you can do that directly in here on GitHub.com**.
- If you are editing in-browser, just press commit below and make a pull request (three times the green button) **and you are done**.
- Otherwise you need to:
  + clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/kthaisociety/midnight-king.git`
  + make a branch with `git checkout -b NAME`.
  + Add your changed file with `git add .`.
  + Commit your changes with `git commit -m "I (don't) love the king"`.
  + Push it with `git push`.
  + Make a pull request via GitHub UI.

Make sure to make your commit and pull request before the time runs out!
